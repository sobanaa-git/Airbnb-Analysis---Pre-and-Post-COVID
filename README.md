# Airbnb-Analysis - Pre and Post COVID

We set out to ascertain the effects of COVID-19 on Airbnb, Inc., an online lodging and rental marketplace, in the Washington, DC region. Our model uses data obtained from Inside Airbnb – an open source, independent collection of Airbnb listings worldwide – for August, September, and October of 2019 and 2020, analyzing the year over year effects based on various variables of interest. Throughout our analysis, we aimed to support our prediction that COVID has affected the number of bookings, price, and rental availability in 2020 compared to 2019. Our group performed descriptive analytics methods to gain further insight into the dataset. These included comparison and analyses of price, 30-day availability, booking rate, listing count based on room type, and visual displays of results through graphs and charts, along with a cluster analysis to understand our dataset. In addition, we performed predictive analytics methods to project price and occupancy of rentals, pre and post COVID. These methods included multiple regression, KNN, and regression trees; we built and ran multiple models to ensure we used the model with best fit and the lowest margin of error for our predictions, offering the most accurate value possible. In completing these methods, through our descriptive and predictive analysis, we reached a conclusion that COVID-19 has undeniably affected the Airbnb, Inc. market in Washington, DC, aligning with our predictio
